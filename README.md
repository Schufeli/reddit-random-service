Reddit Random is a small microservice API to fetch a random Post from any requested Subreddit. Written entirely in C#, built on ASP.NET Core 3.1 with Docker support.
## ðŸ“¦ Installation
A Docker image is available on the public [docker registry](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/schufeli/reddit-random-service) which you can use as you like. The only thing you have to provide to the container is two environment variables:
```
USER_AGENT=<Your Useragent Name>
API_KEY=<Your defined Key>
```

For the User-Agent and other API rules please consult the [Official Reddit Documentation](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/API)

### Docker pull
```
docker pull schufeli/reddit-random-service
```

### Docker run
```
docker run -p "<Port>:80" --name reddit-random-service -e API_KEY="<API Key>" -e USER_AGENT="<Useragent>" reddit-random-service
```
### Docker-Compose
Please have a look at the provided [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/Schufeli/reddit-random/blob/create-release-version/docker-compose.yml) file.

## ðŸš€ How to use
__Please note, for the Service to function properly you will need to provide a valid Reddit Access token with at least the read scope.__

If you need to know how to get a Reddit Access token please consult this [Guide](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/OAuth2) 

### Request a Post
To fetch a Post from the Service you will need to send an HTTP GET Request to your hosted Reddit Random Service (I will use localhost in the following examples!).

``` 
https://localhost<:Port>/reddit/<Subreddit> 
```

You also have to add two additional Headers to your Request use the following table as a reference.

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| ApiKey | Your defined Apikey (See Installation) |
| AccessToken | Valid Reddit Api Accesstoken |

### Response
If your request was successful you will get a JSON object which is similar to the following example with the description of each element.

```json
